# CS3214-Project-2-Threadpool
A Fork-Join Threadpool

In this project, a small fork/join framework was created that allows the parallel execution of divide-and-conquer algorithms 
such as the one shown in the example in the Figure below in a resource-efficient manner. 
To that end, a thread pool implementation for dynamic task parallelism was created, focusing on the execution of so-called fork/join tasks.
